# Machine Learning for Predicting Risk of Early Stage Diabetes

## Description
For this report, I used supervised machine learning algorithms to classify whether a patient has diabetes or not. First, I extracted the most important features from the data by using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Then I applied Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Na√Øve Bayes Classifier to the patient profile data. From here, I was able to gain insight on which feature explains the classification of having early stage diabetes or not. 

## Installation
Using python with installed packages pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib and sklearn anyone can run the models used in the analysis. 

## Data
I found this dataset on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset. 

In the pca.py file I performed Principal Component Analysis to find the most important features from the data. 
In the diabetes.py file all machine learning models were performed.
